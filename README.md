# NAS platform

Ansible-owned infrastructure for an ASUSTOR AS6704T NAS. Ansible is the only
control plane: it prepares storage, renders configuration from an encrypted vault,
deploys the Compose stacks, provisions first-run identities, wires services to one
another, and verifies the result.

This repository recreates service *configuration*. It is not a backup of photos,
media, databases or application state. Keep those in a separate encrypted,
off-site backup. RAID is not a backup.

## Design

**Nothing is manual after the first run.** Two residues are irreducible and are
stated rather than engineered around: someone must author the vault once and hold
its password, because that is the root of trust; and credentials issued by a third
party, such as a Gmail app password, must be obtained by a human.

**Vault is always first.** Every credential is authored in vault and flows one
direction. Nothing is read back from a running service, so a run converges in a
single pass. Where a service would normally hand you a generated value to
copy-paste, we supply ours instead: ntfy accepts declarative users, ACL entries
and tokens, and Beszel uses a hub keypair placed on disk before first start.

**Ansible converges on every run.** Configuration changed in a web UI is reverted
by the next run, which is what makes the repository describe reality. Review with
`--check --diff` before applying.

**Definitions are portable.** Compose files reference `${NAS_DOCKER_ROOT:?}` and
`${NAS_MEDIA_ROOT:?}` rather than absolute paths, so the same definitions run
unmodified against the NAS, a workstation sandbox and CI. Required-variable
syntax means an unset value fails loudly instead of silently creating a relative
bind mount.

**Run location does not matter.** One inventory host with the connection switched:
`inventory/local.yml` on the NAS, `inventory/remote.yml` from a workstation. Every
task, including HTTP calls, runs on that host, so loopback addresses are correct
in both modes.

## Layout

```
site.yml                inventory/            services/<name>/compose.yml
verify.yml              roles/<name>/         tests/
generate-secrets.yml    requirements.yml      docs/
```

## First run

Prerequisites on the NAS: Docker with the Compose plugin 2.18.0 or newer, and
python3, which Ansible needs in both run modes.

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

# Author credentials once, review the identity fields, then encrypt.
ansible-playbook generate-secrets.yml
mv inventory/group_vars/all/vault-plain.yml inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml
ansible-vault encrypt inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml

# Review, then apply.
ansible-playbook -i inventory/remote.yml site.yml --check --diff --ask-vault-pass
ansible-playbook -i inventory/remote.yml site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Keep the vault password in a password manager. The encrypted vault is committed;
its password never is.

## Testing

```sh
ruby tests/policy_test.rb      # property checks, no service-specific literals
ansible-lint --strict          # production profile
tests/integration.sh site.yml  # converge, re-converge, then --check --diff
```

The integration harness runs Ansible in a Linux container against a disposable
sandbox, so the plays meet a real `/proc/mounts`, real numeric uid and gid, and a
real Docker socket. It asserts three properties: the run converges, a second run
changes nothing, and a dry run works. Two of the worst bugs found so far, a fact
that exists only on Linux and `command` being skipped under `--check`, both passed
syntax checking and were caught only by running.

Jellyfin and Immich cannot be exercised anywhere but the NAS, because both map
`/dev/dri` and Compose merges `devices` by appending, so no override can remove
them.

## Manual escape hatch

Ansible owns deployment, but a stack can be brought up by hand if needed, using
the environment file Ansible rendered:

```sh
docker compose --env-file services/ntfy/.env -f services/ntfy/compose.yml up -d
```

## Security boundary

Safe to commit: Compose definitions, pinned image digests, port and volume
mappings, roles, the **encrypted** vault, and documentation.

Never commit: the vault password, any decrypted vault copy, rendered `.env` files,
plaintext credentials, or application data.
